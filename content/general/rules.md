# Welcome to the STARFALL Community!

We're thrilled to have you here, and we hope that you have a great time while you're a part of our community.

## Community Guidelines

To make sure that everyone can enjoy their time here, we ask that you follow a few simple guidelines:

* **Engage in a friendly way:** We want this community to be a welcoming and supportive place for all gamers, regardless of their experience level or background. Please treat your fellow community members with kindness and respect, and avoid any language or behavior that could be considered offensive or hurtful.

* **Encourage collaboration:** Gaming is all about teamwork, and we believe that our community should be no different. We encourage you to work together with other community members, share tips and strategies, and help each other improve your skills.

* **Invite your friends:** The more, the merrier! We're always looking to expand our community and meet new gamers. If you know someone who you think would enjoy being a part of STARFALL, please invite them to join us.

* **No cheating or hacking:** Cheating or using hacks to gain an unfair advantage in games is not allowed in our community. We believe in fair play and respect for other players, so please don't cheat or use hacks of any kind.

* **No spamming or self-promotion:** While we encourage community members to share their gaming content and streams, we ask that you do so in moderation. Please do not spam the community with constant self-promotion, and make sure that any content you share is relevant to the community.

* **Respect the moderators:** Our moderators are here to ensure that everyone can have a positive and enjoyable experience in our community. Please respect their decisions and follow their instructions if they ask you to do something.

* **No hate speech or discriminatory language:** We have a zero-tolerance policy for hate speech or discriminatory language of any kind. This includes language that targets individuals or groups based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other characteristic.

* **Keep it PG-13:** While we understand that gaming can be an intense and exciting experience, we ask that you keep your language and behavior appropriate for a PG-13 audience. Please avoid excessive profanity, graphic violence, or any other content that could be considered inappropriate for a general audience. Some of your fellow community members may be streaming, and excessive language or behavior may cause issues for them.

We believe that by following these rules can help promote a positive and welcoming environment for all members of your community. Be sure to clearly communicate these rules to your community members and enforce them consistently to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone.

Thanks for being a part of STARFALL, and happy gaming!
